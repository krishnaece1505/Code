// ----------------------- README for the Digital Watch ----------------------- //
---- The watch has been designed using Adafruit Pro Trinket (based on Arduino
     Pro Mini) and Heltec 0.96" 128 X 64 OLED display
     
---- The watch includes basic date and time settings

---- The date and time adjustments are done using the embedded LDR sensor

---- A flashlight is used to signal the watch that the time or data has been
     set. This is indicated by a temporary glow of the embedded green LED
