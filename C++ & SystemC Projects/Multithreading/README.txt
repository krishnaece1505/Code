Multithreading using thread.h in C++. An image of size 5152 X 3864 was blurred
using a single thread and two threads. The two thread execution was 1.15 times 
faster than the single thread execution. The code was tested on a Surface Pro 3
with i5-4300U processor and 4GB ram using Visual Studio 2015. The results may 
vary on a computer with a different processor or architecture.
